# Personalized Suggestion Engine

## Overview

This document details the recommendation system that translates fatigue assessments into actionable interventions. Our engine combines evidence-based recovery protocols with machine learning to deliver personalized, effective suggestions tailored to each user's unique response patterns.

---

## Design Philosophy

1. **Evidence-Based**: Every intervention backed by cognitive neuroscience research
2. **Personalized**: Adapt to individual effectiveness patterns
3. **Tiered Response**: Match intervention intensity to fatigue level
4. **Minimal Friction**: Easy to implement, immediately accessible
5. **Learning System**: Improve recommendations based on outcomes
6. **Variety**: Prevent habituation through diverse interventions

---

## Part 1: Micro-Interventions (Immediate Relief)

### Purpose
Provide fast, effective relief for specific types of cognitive fatigue (1-3 minutes).

---

### 1. Attention Fatigue Recovery

**Target**: Sustained attention exhaustion, difficulty focusing

**"20-20-20 Eye Rule + Peripheral Vision Exercise"**

**Protocol** (1 minute):
```
1. Look at something 20 feet away (20 seconds)
2. Slowly scan the peripheral edges of your vision
3. Notice 5 objects without moving your eyes
4. Blink slowly 10 times
5. Return to center, refocus
```

**Expected Impact**: 15% focus restoration

**Scientific Basis**: Reduces eye strain, resets visual attention system

**Delivery**:
```
👁️ Attention Reset (60 seconds)

Your focus is fragmenting. This quick exercise
resets visual attention.

### 2. Decision Fatigue Relief

**Target**: Choice overwhelm, decision paralysis

**"Decision Templates & Mental Offloading"**

**Protocol** (Instant):
```
1. Defer: "I'll decide this at [specific time]"
2. Delegate: "Who else can make this?"
3. Default: "What's my pre-set rule for this?"
4. Dice: "For trivial choices, randomize"
```

**Expected Impact**: 30% cognitive load reduction

**Scientific Basis**: Reduces ego depletion from decision-making

**Delivery**:
```
🎯 Decision Helper

Feeling decision fatigue? Use these mental shortcuts:

[Defer It] [Delegate It] [Use Default Rule]

Or set it aside in your "Decide Later" queue.

[Add to Queue]
```

## Part 3: Lifestyle Optimization Recommendations

### Purpose
Long-term strategic changes for sustainable cognitive performance.

---

### 1. Chronobiological Alignment

**Assessment**: Analyze user's performance patterns to identify natural rhythms

**Recommendations**:

**For "Night Owl Strugglers"**:
```
🌙 Chronotype Optimization Plan

Your data shows evening-optimal performance,
but morning-heavy schedule.

Strategies:
1. Morning Light Exposure
   - 15 min bright light within 1 hour of waking
   - Gradually shifts circadian rhythm

2. Task Scheduling
   - Routine tasks: Morning
   - Complex work: Afternoon/evening
   - Meetings: After 10 AM when possible

3. Sleep Timing
   - Current: 12 AM - 7 AM
   - Target: 11 PM - 6 AM (gradual 15min shifts)

4. Workplace Advocacy
   - [Template email] requesting flexible hours

Expected Improvement: -15% average fatigue

[Start Gradual Adjustment Plan]
```

**For "Morning Larks"**:
```
🌅 Optimize Your Morning Advantage

You're a natural early performer.

Recommendations:
1. Protect 8-11 AM for deep work (block calendar)
2. Frontload complex decisions before noon
3. Afternoon: Meetings & collaborative work
4. Early bedtime (9:30-10 PM) to maintain edge

[Auto-Schedule Optimization]
```

---

### 2. Cognitive Load Management

**"Meeting Hygiene Rules"**

**Based on User's Data**:
```
📊 Your Meeting Impact Analysis

Data shows:
• Back-to-back meetings: +35% fatigue increase
• Meetings >60 min: Productivity drops 40% after
• Post-meeting recovery: 15-20 minutes needed

Personalized Rules:
1. Max 2 consecutive meetings
2. 15-minute buffer between meetings (mandatory)
3. Meeting limit: 4 hours/day
4. No meetings before 9:30 AM (your ramp-up time)

[Apply to Calendar] [Share with Team]
```

**"Task Batching Strategy"**:
```
🎯 Optimized Task Sequencing

Your best cognitive flow:

Morning (8-11 AM):
• Deep work block (90 min)
• Break (10 min)
• Creative tasks (60 min)

Midday (11 AM-1 PM):
• Meetings, collaboration
• Lunch break (30 min minimum)

Afternoon (1-4 PM):
• Routine tasks (email, admin)
• Break (15 min at 2:30 PM)
• Moderate complexity work

Late Day (4-6 PM):
• Planning tomorrow
• Wrap-up, close loops
• No new complex tasks

[Auto-Schedule Tasks]
```

**"Attention Residue Minimization"**:
```
🔀 Context-Switching Costs

Your data: Task switching adds 8 minutes to
recovery time per switch.

Daily cost: ~60 minutes lost to attention residue

Solutions:
1. Theme Days (Mon: Writing, Tue: Meetings, etc.)
2. Task batching (all emails at once, not scattered)
3. "Switching Break" (5 min between different task types)
4. Do Not Disturb blocks for deep work

Potential Recovery: 1 hour/day

[Implement System]
```

## Part 5: Adaptive Recommendation Engine

### Machine Learning Personalization

**How It Works**:

```python
# Pseudocode for recommendation selection

def select_intervention(user_state, user_history):
    # Get current context
    current_fatigue = user_state.fatigue_score
    fatigue_type = identify_dominant_fatigue_type(user_state)
    available_time = user_state.time_available
    location = user_state.location

    # Get intervention history
    past_effectiveness = user_history.intervention_outcomes

    # Generate candidate interventions
    candidates = filter_interventions(
        fatigue_level=current_fatigue,
        fatigue_type=fatigue_type,
        duration_max=available_time,
        location_appropriate=location
    )

    # Rank by predicted effectiveness for THIS user
    ranked = sort_by_effectiveness(
        candidates,
        user_effectiveness_profile=past_effectiveness
    )

    # Return top 3 with variety
    return select_diverse_top_k(ranked, k=3)
```

---

### Intervention Effectiveness Tracking

**User Feedback Loop**:

After each intervention:
```
How effective was this 5-minute reset?

Fatigue Before: 58
Fatigue After: [User rates]

[Much Worse] [Worse] [Same] [Better] [Much Better]

[Optional: What helped most?]
□ Breathing
□ Movement
□ Mental offload
□ Other: ________
```

**System Learning**:
- Tracks intervention → outcome patterns
- Adjusts recommendation probabilities
- Personalizes protocol components

**Example Personalization**:
```
User A Response Profile:
- Breathing exercises: +18% avg improvement
- Physical movement: +25% avg improvement ⭐
- Mental exercises: +10% avg improvement

User B Response Profile:
- Breathing exercises: +22% avg improvement ⭐
- Physical movement: +8% avg improvement
- Mental exercises: +20% avg improvement

→ System prioritizes movement for User A,
   breathing/mental for User B
