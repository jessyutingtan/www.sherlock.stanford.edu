# Brain Fatigue Scoring AI Tool - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

This is a next-generation mobile application for comprehensive brain fatigue assessment, prediction, and management. Unlike existing wellness apps that use simple questionnaires, our solution employs a multi-dimensional metrics framework combining behavioral biomarkers, cognitive micro-tests, and AI-powered pattern recognition to provide actionable, personalized insights.

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Multi-Layered Data Collection
- **Rapid Pulse Checks**: 5-second micro-assessments throughout the day
- **Behavioral Biomarkers**: Passive monitoring of typing dynamics, app switching, scroll behavior
- **Cognitive Micro-Tests**: 30-60 second gamified assessments (Flanker, N-Back, PVT, Stroop)
- **Contextual Intelligence**: Environmental and situational factor correlation

### 2. Advanced AI Capabilities
- **Fatigue Phenotype Identification**: Classify users into distinct patterns (Cliff Diver, Slow Burner, Rollercoaster, etc.)
- **Multi-System Assessment**: Evaluate executive, emotional, social, creative, and physical-cognitive fatigue
- **Predictive Analytics**: Short-term (4-hour), medium-term (7-day), and long-term (30+ day) forecasting
- **Burnout Prevention**: Early warning system with risk scoring

### 3. Personalized Intervention Engine
- **Micro-Interventions**: Immediate relief protocols (1-3 minutes)
- **Recovery Protocols**: Strategic restoration plans (5-90 minutes)
- **Lifestyle Optimization**: Chronobiological alignment and cognitive load management
- **Adaptive Recommendations**: AI-learned interventions based on individual response patterns

### 4. Unique Features
- **Cognitive Signature Profile**: Unique "cognitive fingerprint" for each user
- **Fatigue Velocity Tracker**: Real-time fatigue accumulation rate monitoring
- **Cognitive Budget Monitor**: Daily cognitive resource allocation dashboard
- **Cognitive Weather Report**: Daily mental performance forecast
